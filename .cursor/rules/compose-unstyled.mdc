This project uses the Compose Unstyled library for UI development.

The project does not have any of Material 3 Compose or Material Compose dependencies.

Compose Unstyled brings in fully accessible, fully renderless components that you can use to build components with.

You can find all components by visiting: https://composables.com/docs/compose-unstyled)

Each primitive has its own API reference and implements the respective UX of the component.

Look at the documentation for the API reference of the component.

Compose Unstyled also comes with its own flexible theming API system. It is token based

When creating components, make sure to have them themable based off the theme's tokens in Theme.kt
